# BioGears GSoC'20 : Website Porter
#### 24th August 2020

### Describe my work briefly
 
* Creating the Website Porter to port the whole website code from Java to Python.
* Generate CMake targets to execute those Python Scripts.
* Merging to the Repository for GSoC'20.

### What is done

* Generation of code documentation for execution of Website using Java thereby solving the issue [#43](https://github.com/BioGearsEngine/core/issues/43).
* Rewriting CDM2MD class in Python thereby porting the whole website by which we can generate with the help of XSDToDoxygen.py , CDM2MD.py , DoxygenPreprocessor.py script thereby solving the issue [#44](https://github.com/BioGearsEngine/core/issues/44).
* Creating Plotting Tools in Python thereby writing scripts for that which are PlotDriver.py, ActionEventPlotter.py and Multiplotter.py for creation of Plotting graphs using python thereby solving the issue [#45](https://github.com/BioGearsEngine/core/issues/45).
* Generating of code documentation with Python which involves step by step execution of script wich resolves issue [#42](https://github.com/BioGearsEngine/core/issues/42).
* After that I have optimized the code with the help of adding verbose related statements adding threads for faster execution of program code.
* My Pull Request can be seen here --> [BioGears Pull Request](https://github.com/BioGearsEngine/core/pull/46).
